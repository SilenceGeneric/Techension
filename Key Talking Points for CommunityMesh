2. Mesh Network Communication System:
   
- Outline the plan for implementing a mesh network communication system using ESP32 microcontrollers and solar power.
   
- Highlight the importance of decentralized communication in emergency situations.

3. Community Gardens and Food Security:

In that case, you're not going to be driving your car downtown. If there's mobs of armed thugs roaming streets trying to rob people for the resources, instead we could take that battery out of your car and connect it to our solar system to utilize more energy storing capabilities. Something edit this later etc etc. (
